There are 2-3 ways. One is, as you say, is to use arguments.callee. It might be the only way if you're dealing with an anonymous function that's not stored assigned to a variable somewhere (that you know of):

(function() {
    return arguments.callee;
})()()()().... ;

The 2nd is to use the function's name

function namedFunc() {
    return namedFunc;
}
namedFunc()()()().... ;

And the last one is to use an anonymous function assigned to a variable, but you have to know the variable, so in that case I see no reason, why you can't just give the function a name, and use the method above

var storedFunc = function() {
    return storedFunc;
};
storedFunc()()()().... ;

They're all functionally identical, but callee is the simplest.

Edit: And I agree with SLaks; I can't recommend it either
